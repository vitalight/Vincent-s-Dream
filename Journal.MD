Today we made a great decision: we won't allow Zrdumped to do his coding without giving him the document._(:з」∠)_

And said Vitalight, 'I have a dream ...... I have a dream that one day the game, Van-Goph-s-Dream, shall be brought to the world".╭(′▽`)╭(′▽`)╯

So, happy writing documents, Vita!(*≧∪≦) 

Note: to make sure Vita won't beat me, I won't make this file as README.ヽ(`З’)ﾉ

And I guess I won't update this Journal.d(･｀ω´･d*)

And I guess Vita will delete this file as well.┭┮﹏┭┮
